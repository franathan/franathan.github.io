## Desert to Rainforest: A Cross-Section of the Andes Through Peru

One of my favorite field experiences, I had the chance to travel across Peru in the spring of 2019. Sponsored by the 
Honors Program through the Jackson School of Geosciences at The University of Texas at Austin, a few brave professors led
 a group of students across the Andes to examine tectonics, soil, glacial deposits, and sedimentary processes.

Northernmost extent of the Atacoma Desert, the driest nonpolar desert in the world.

The Altiplano is one of the highest plateaus on Earth. Changes in the angle of subduction of the Nazca Plate beneath the
 South American Plate aid in the extreme elevation. Also Alpacas!

Sharp chevron folds show off the tectonics.

Notice the changes in the angle of the strata as you look from left to right. This type of faulting (growth faults)
indicates synchronous tectonics and sediment deposition

U-shaped valleys are carved by glaciers. Glaciers are geology's bulldozers.

The large slope in the foreground is a glacial moraine which indicates the furthest extent of the glacial.
