## High Order Stratigraphic Framework of Intraslope Growth Faulted Subbasins Offshore Matagorda Bay, Texas



### ABSTRACT
Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is currently one of the leading atmospheric emission mitigation technologies. To have 
meaningful impact on the atmosphere CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations, megatons (10<sup>6</sup>) of CO<sub>2</sub> must be removed from the carbon cycle 
permanently. This requires subsurface geologic storage sites that are both volumetrically significant and secure over 
geologic time-scales. The northern Gulf of Mexico (GOM) can serve as a major location for CCS. Miocene strandplain 
systems in the GOM are an ideal stratigraphy for such storage due to their proximity to emission sources, quality sand 
reservoirs, and depth relative to overpressure.

This study focuses on a suite of strike parallel subbasins within the Lower Miocene offshore of Matagorda Bay, TX. Each 
subbasin has potential to serve as a future carbon sequestration site. Accurate mapping of subbasins’ stratigraphy is 
necessary to understand the variable thickness and associated risk of reservoir-sealing shale intervals, recognizing 
that injection beneath thicker, more uniformly distributed shales is more favorable. These intervals must be mapped at 
high resolution (4th order cyclicity) to understand the individual components in assessment and risk analysis. 

This research generates a novel dip-steered seismic volume which is leveraged to improve seismic attribute calculations 
and mapping at the 4th order. The dip-steered seismic volume records the seismic dip in the inline and crossline 
direction of seismic features at the intersection of every inline, crossline, and seismic sample. This volume is used 
to generate a model of dense, 3D, auto-tracked horizons across each subbasin. The models better connect high 
resolution, but sparse, well log data and low resolution, but continuous, seismic data. Thickness distributions and 
shale interval maps generated from the models aid in risk assessment. Based on the resulting shale thicknesses, the 
suite of subbasins should be further considered as future storage sites.


### INTRODUCTION

The area of interest of this study is a suite of subbasins located offshore Matagorda Bay, Texas within the Lower 
Miocene 2 interval [Figure 1](#figure-1). This interval consists of a siliciclastic wedge approximately 600 m thick which was 
deposited in a strandplain depositional environment between the North Padre Delta to the south and the Calcasieu Delta 
to the North (Galloway, 1989, Xu et al., 2016). The study area consists of five ‘subbasins’ [Figure 2](#figure-2). Each subbasin 
is bounded landward by a listric growth fault extending through the Miocene interval separating Miocene deposits from 
underlying Oligocene deposits. The subbasins are bounded basinward by another listric growth fault which in turn marks 
the landward edge of another more distal subbasin. Subbasins are bounded laterally by structural ridges that form 
perpendicular to strike. The formation of these subbasins is caused by interplay of Oligo-Miocene clastic deposition 
and halokenesis of allochthonous salt deposits. The sediment fill of each subbasin consists of interbedded sands and 
shales. The sand bodies have the potential to act as reservoirs for injected CO<sub>2</sub> with the overlying shales acting as 
the top seal. Accurate mapping of the distribution of shale thicknesses at a high resolution (4th order) will improve 
assessing the risk associated with the top seal for a carbon injection site.

### METHODS
To accomplish the seismic interpretation necessary for 4th order analysis of each subbasin and have an accurate 
assessment of shale thickness and spatial distribution, a few novel seismic techniques are used. A dip-steered seismic 
volume records the dip of seismic features as vectors at the intersection of every inline, crossline, and seismic 
sample interval. A dip-steered volume can enhance imaging of seismic data and allow for improvement of some seismic 
attribute calculations (e.g. curvature, similarity, dip fields), fault tracking, and gridding of seismic horizons 
(Ishak et al., 2018; Abdullah and Pranowo, 2020). Processing a seismic volume to create a dip-steered volume involves 
the calculation of the degree of dip in both the inline and crossline directions. These vectors are estimated using 
Principal Component Analysis and eigenvalue decomposition of the seismic amplitude field [Figure 3](#figure-3). These dip vectors 
are then used to aid in creating a model of dense, 3D, auto-tracked horizons. The intervals between horizons in this 
model are at a higher resolution than seismic reflectors and capture changes in thickness of shale intervals. 

Well log data aids in the stratigraphic interpretation of the model. Well logs within a subbasin are correlated and 
interpreted as sand or shale intervals [Figure 4](#figure-4). These interpretations are assigned to intervals within the model. 
Distributions of the interpreted 4th order shale and sand thicknesses and associated thickness maps are generated 
for each interpreted stratigraphic interval.

the direction of the highest change in amplitude which is perpendicular to the dip. The second and third principal 
components are perpendicular to the first and define the plane of the seismic event. With these vectors defined, the 
dip can be calculated in the inline and crossline direction.

indicates presence of clays and is associated with shales, while a low spontaneous potential response is associated 
with sands.

### RESULTS
A simple use case can serve as an example of the benefits of the methods presented in this study. In this scenario, 
there are two possible injection sites for a CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration site within a subbasin. Both sites have identical pore 
volume, cost of injection, and high-quality trap. The only difference between the two potential sites is the shale 
interval that would act as a top-seal for the reservoir. Only one of these two reservoirs can be chosen for injection. 
[Figure 5](#figure-5) shows a histogram of thickness distributions for each of the shales. These distributions are each made up of 
10 samples, representing the 10 previous wells drilled in the area. The distributions show that Interval 1 has a higher 
median thickness compared to Interval 2. Understanding that a thicker shale interval is associated with less risk in 
terms of potential leakage of CO<sub>2</sub> from the reservoir, it would seem injection of CO<sub>2</sub> beneath Interval 1 would have a 
lower associated risk than injection beneath Interval 2. However, concerns about potential failure of the top-seal 
promote further analysis of the shale intervals. The workflow presented in this study is followed and high-resolution 
thickness maps are generated for the two intervals. [Figure 6](#figure-6) shows the thickness maps of both Interval 1 and Interval 2. 
These high-resolution maps generated using dip-steered seismic data have the potential to change the risk assessment 
of the two seals. Though Interval 1 has a higher median thickness, the map shows a higher degree of undulation in 
the shale thickness. The center of Interval 1 thins to 30% of the median thickness. Interval 2 is much more uniform 
in its spatial distribution. This new information may change the relative risk associated with these two intervals, 
and it may become more favorable to inject beneath Interval 2 shale. Though its median thickness is less than the 
TST 1 interval, its uniform distribution lowers the risk of leakage.

(i.e. well data). From these distributions it appears that Interval 1 has less associated risk regarding sealing 
capacity due to the higher median thickness.

Comparison of the spatial variability in thickness distribution between Shale Intervals 1 and 2 for the use case. 
Interval 1 shows high variability with some areas less than 80 ft of shale. Interval 2 is more uniform across the 
subbasin and thus may be associated with a lower risk in terms of sealing capacity for CO<sub>2</sub> injection.

### SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
The methods presented to access the thickness of shale intervals at a high resolution has proven to be useful and 
worthwhile for subbasins offshore Matagorda Bay, TX. The creation of dense, 3D auto-tracked models allow interpreters 
to combine the high resolution of well log data with the spatial coverage of a seismic survey. Well log properties can 
be applied to intervals much finer than a single seismic reflection. The use of dip-steered seismic data has shown to 
have great potential to improve risk assessment for CO<sub>2</sub> storage sites. Accurate assessment of the sealing capacity of 
a carbon injection reservoir is an important aspect for consideration. Reservoirs must be considered stable for geologic
periods to be viable injection targets. Thin shales pose a risk of failure during the injection of CO<sub>2</sub> from the increase
of pressure (Yang et al., 2019). Shales must also withstand pressure changes as the CO<sub>2</sub> migrates from the injection 
site to the updip seal of the reservoir (Leetaru et al., 2009).

Carbon Sequestration is an important technology to reduce the total amount of greenhouse gases currently in the 
Earth’s atmosphere. As industries and countries strive towards net zero emissions targets, it is likely that carbon 
sequestration will play an integral role in these pursuits. Identification and characterization of potential CO<sub>2</sub> 
reservoirs is necessary before large amounts of CO<sub>2</sub> gas are captured and transported. A suite of Miocene subbasins 
exist offshore Matagorda Bay, TX that have been identified as potential CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration sites. Analysis of the 
sediment fill of these subbasins is important for twofold reasons. 1) accurate mapping of the thickness of sands and 
shales present in the subbasin is important for economic risk assessment of storage sites & 2) the suite of subbasins 
analyzed in this study are a subset of many more Miocene subbasins that exist along strike, each having the potential 
to act as secure, long-term storage of CO<sub>2</sub>.
